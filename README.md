## Running Your ASP.NET Members Only Clubhouse

**Ready to see your Members Only Clubhouse come to life?**  Here's how to get started:

1. **Fire Up the Development Server:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your project files.  
   Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The command will automatically build and launch your ASP.NET application. You'll see messages in the terminal indicating a successful build and the assigned port number (often `http://localhost:5217/`).

2. **Open Your Members Only Clubhouse WebApp in the Browser:**
   Copy the provided port number (e.g., `5217`) from the terminal output.
   Paste it after `http://localhost:` in your web browser's address bar, typically like this:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:5217
   ```

   Press Enter, and voila! Your ASP.NET Members Only Clubhouse Website should be up and running in your browser.
